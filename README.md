I have successfully completed a task for my Data Science internship at Prodigy Infotech. 
In this project, I delved into the analysis and visualization of sentiment patterns within social media data. Using the Twitter entity sentiment analysis dataset.
I explored public opinions and attitudes toward specific topics, providing insights that could help in understanding the broader social narrative.
